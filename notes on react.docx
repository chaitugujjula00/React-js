  React.createElement => object => HTMLElement(render)

 const heading = React.createElement("h1",{id:"heading"},"It is the heading");

  JSX in  React 
 JSX is not HTML, it is HTML - like syntax

 const jsxheading = <h1>It is heading using JSX</h1>

 React component
 class based component - OLD
  Functional component - NEW( It is a function of javascript)
 const HeadingComponent =() =>{
     return <h1>Heading Component</h1>
 }
 or
 const HeadingComponent2 =() => <h1>Component 2</h1>


 for adding a component from one file to other file
 => use export in inital file and import in using file.


 Two types of export 
 1) (Default import)
 export default component;
  import component
  first type don't have {} in import
 2) (Named import)
 export const component1;
  export const component2; 
    import {component1/component2}
    need to use {} for import in this type of export

Can we use default import and named import combined?
ans : Yes we can use both in a single folder.

State variable - it is a super powerful variable
# react hook - normal JS utility functions
 - useState() -  super powerful variables in React
 - useEffect()

 eg for state variable : const [listofRes,setlistofRes] = useState([]);
setlistofRes is function to update listofRes state variable
